TransLink offers **secure bicycle parking** at select SkyTrain stations.
These are well-lit and high-visibility bike parkade rooms located near a station entrance.
Access to these bike parkades requires advance registration in order to obtain a keycard to get inside.
Once inside, the bike racks are first-come-first-serve, and you need to bring your own lock.

Bike parkades are currently operational at:

* **Main Street-Science World Station**, which opened May 2014. It's by the east entrance.
* **King George Station**, which opened July 2015. It's by the east entrance.

Bike parkades are planned for:

* **Commercial-Broadway Station**, as part of the [Phase 2 upgrades](http://www.translink.ca/-/media/Documents/plans_and_projects/station_exchange_improvements/commercial_broadway_stn_upg/commercial_broadway_open_house_boards_december_2014.pdf) currently in progress and expected to be complete by summer 2017. It'll be at the south end of the south stationhouse, fronting 10th Ave.
* **Joyce Station**, as part of the [station upgrade project](http://www.translink.ca/-/media/Documents/plans_and_projects/station_exchange_improvements/joyce_collingwood/joyce_collingwood_information_boards_december_2014.pdf) currently in progress and expected to be complete by fall 2017. It'll be by the east entrance.
* **Metrotown Station**, as part of [Phase 3 of its station upgrade project](http://www.translink.ca/en/Plans-and-Projects/Station-and-Exchange-Improvements/Expo-Line-Upgrades/Metrotown-Station-Upgrades.aspx). Phase 3 is expected to complete in winter 2017/2018.

All existing and planned bike parkades are located at Expo Line SkyTrain stations.
