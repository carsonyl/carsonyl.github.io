Hi! My name's **Carson Lam**. I'm a Software Developer at [Safe Software] in Surrey, BC.

I made [TransitDB.ca], a website that provides a different perspective on public transit schedules in Metro Vancouver. It's also got an app for [Android] and [BlackBerry].

I graduated from the [University of British Columbia][UBC] in 2013, and spent a year on academic exchange at the [National University of Singapore][NUS].
